I go to school every morning.
He doesn’t like to talk so much.
He likes to read a lot.
Today is Sunday.
I want to write more sentences.
He makes fun of your intentions.
You don’t argue about important things.
The quick brown fox jumps over the log.
The cat stares at the wall.
I always make mistakes when I have to do something important.
